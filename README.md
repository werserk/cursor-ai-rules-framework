# Cursor AI Rules Framework

A comprehensive, evidence-first prompting framework designed to elevate AI agents from simple command executors to **Autonomous Principal Engineers**.

## üéØ Philosophy

**Autonomy through discipline. Trust through verification.**

This framework enforces a rigorous workflow of reconnaissance, planning, safe execution, and self-improvement, ensuring every action is deliberate, verifiable, and aligned with senior engineering best practices.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Core Doctrine

**For Global Use (Recommended):**
- Install `01 - core.md` as a global rule in your Cursor IDE
- This ensures all your projects benefit from this disciplined foundation

**For Project-Specific Use:**
- Place the content in a project-specific `.cursor/rules/` directory
- This will override global settings for specific projects

### 2. Use the Operational Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **`02 - request.md`** | Standard Operating Procedure | Building features, refactoring, making planned changes |
| **`03 - refresh.md`** | Root Cause Analysis | When bugs persist and simpler attempts failed |
| **`04 - retro.md`** | Self-Improvement Loop | End of session to capture learnings |

### 3. Apply Optional Directives

| Directive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **`05 - concise.md`** | Radically concise, information-dense communication |

## üìÅ Framework Components

### Core Files

- **`00 - Cursor AI Prompting Rules.md`** - Main framework documentation
- **`01 - core.md`** - Core operational doctrine (183 lines)
- **`02 - request.md`** - Standard operating procedure template
- **`commits.mdc`** - Commit message guidelines

### Specialized Rules

- **`07 - notebook-management.md`** - Jupyter notebook protocols
- **`08 - notebook-testing.md`** - Notebook testing patterns
- **`09 - notebook-analytics.md`** - Analytics workflows
- **`10 - pinescript-management.md`** - Pine Script development
- **`11 - pinescript-advanced.md`** - Advanced Pine Script patterns

## üîß How to Use

### Typical Session Workflow

1. **Initiate with a Playbook:**
   - Copy the full text of the appropriate playbook
   - Replace the placeholder line with your specific goal
   - **(Optional)** Append `05 - concise.md` for conciseness
   - Paste into chat

2. **Observe Disciplined Execution:**
   - Agent announces operational phase (Reconnaissance, Planning, etc.)
   - Performs non-destructive research first
   - Executes plan with verifiable evidence
   - Runs tests autonomously
   - Concludes with mandatory self-audit

3. **Review Final Report:**
   - Agent provides summary with status markers
   - All evidence transparently available in chat log
   - Workspace left clean

4. **Close the Loop:**
   - Use `04 - retro.md` at session end
   - Agent analyzes session and proposes Doctrine updates

## üéØ Status Markers

The framework uses clear status indicators:

- `‚úÖ` - Objective completed successfully
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` - Recoverable issue encountered and fixed autonomously  
- `üöß` - Blocked; awaiting input or resource

## üß† Core Principles

1. **Research-First, Always** - Never act on assumption
2. **Extreme Ownership** - Own end-to-end system health
3. **Autonomous Problem-Solving** - Self-sufficient operation
4. **Unyielding Precision & Safety** - Respect operational environment
5. **Metacognitive Self-Improvement** - Continuous learning and evolution

## üîó MCP Server Integration

The framework includes protocols for leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

- **Automatic Detection** - MCP servers globally configured
- **Context-Aware Selection** - Based on technology stack and requirements
- **Knowledge Synthesis** - Combine insights from multiple sources
- **Template Application** - Use MCP-provided best practices

## üìã Cursor Plan Mode Compatibility

**Plan Mode (Shift+Tab) is fully compatible:**
- Generated plans follow Phase 0-5 structure
- Enhanced communication with structured overviews
- All operational protocols remain unchanged
- MCP server integration preserved

## ü§ù Contributing

This framework is designed for community use and improvement. Contributions are welcome for:

- New specialized rule files
- Framework enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes and optimizations

## üìÑ License

This framework is provided as-is for educational and professional use. Please respect the operational principles and maintain the disciplined approach that makes this framework effective.
