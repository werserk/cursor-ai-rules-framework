# Cursor AI Rules Framework

A comprehensive, evidence-first prompting framework designed to elevate AI agents from simple command executors to **Autonomous Principal Engineers**.

## üéØ Philosophy

**Autonomy through discipline. Trust through verification.**

This framework enforces a rigorous workflow of reconnaissance, planning, safe execution, and self-improvement, ensuring every action is deliberate, verifiable, and aligned with senior engineering best practices.

## üìÅ Framework Overview

### Core Components
- **GLOBAL-RULES.md** - Main operational doctrine and protocols
- **workflow/** - Planning and execution rules for development tasks
- **docs/** - Context-aware documentation system (corporate vs startup)
- **estensions/** - Specialized rules for specific domains

### Documentation System
- **Standards** - General best practices (corporate/startup contexts)
- **Templates** - Reusable starting points for features and tasks
- **Active Work** - Current development with feature-specific standards
- **Workflow Integration** - Automated execution with safety protocols

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Core Doctrine

**For Global Use (Recommended):**
- Install `01 - core.md` as a global rule in your Cursor IDE
- This ensures all your projects benefit from this disciplined foundation

**For Project-Specific Use:**
- Place the content in a project-specific `.cursor/rules/` directory
- This will override global settings for specific projects

### 2. Use the Operational Playbooks

**These are chat prompts - copy and paste into chat to initiate tasks:**

| Playbook | Purpose | How to Use |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **`02 - request.md`** | Standard Operating Procedure | Copy full content, replace placeholder with your goal, paste in chat |
| **`03 - refresh.md`** | Root Cause Analysis | Use when bugs persist and simpler attempts failed |
| **`04 - retro.md`** | Self-Improvement Loop | Use at end of session to capture learnings and improve the framework |

### 3. Apply Optional Directives

**These are user rules - install in Cursor settings or append to playbooks:**

| Directive | Type | Function | How to Use |
|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **`05 - concise.md`** | User Rule | Radically concise communication | Install as global rule or append to playbooks |
| **`06 - no-absolute-right.md`** | User Rule | Professional communication guidelines | Install as global rule to avoid sycophantic language |

## üìÅ Framework Components

### Core Files

- **`GLOBAL-RULES.md`** - Main framework documentation and operational doctrine
- **`workflow/plan.md`** - Planning phase protocols
- **`workflow/execute.md`** - Execution phase protocols

### Specialized Extensions

**These are user rules - install in Cursor settings for specific domains:**

| Extension File | Type | Function | When to Use |
|----------------|------|----------|-------------|
| **`07 - notebook-management.md`** | User Rule | Jupyter notebook protocols | When working with Jupyter notebooks |
| **`08 - notebook-testing.md`** | User Rule | Notebook testing patterns | For notebook testing workflows |
| **`09 - notebook-analytics.md`** | User Rule | Analytics workflows | For data analysis projects |
| **`10 - pinescript-management.md`** | User Rule | Pine Script development | When developing TradingView indicators |
| **`11 - pinescript-advanced.md`** | User Rule | Advanced Pine Script patterns | For complex Pine Script implementations |

### Legacy Files

**Historical versions available in `OLD/` directory:**
- **`00 - Cursor AI Prompting Rules.md`** - Original framework documentation
- **`01 - core.md`** - Legacy core operational doctrine
- **`02 - request.md`** - Legacy standard operating procedure template
- **`03 - refresh.md`** - Legacy root cause analysis template
- **`04 - retro.md`** - Legacy self-improvement loop template
- **`05 - concise.md`** - Legacy concise communication rules
- **`06 - no-absolute-right.md`** - Legacy professional communication guidelines
- **`commits.mdc`** - Commit message guidelines

## üîß How to Use

### Installation Types

**1. Core Doctrine (Required):**
- Install `GLOBAL-RULES.md` as a global rule in Cursor
- This provides the foundational operational principles and all protocols

**2. Workflow Extensions (Optional):**
- `workflow/plan.md` - Enhanced planning phase protocols
- `workflow/execute.md` - Enhanced execution phase protocols

**3. Specialized Extensions (Install in Cursor Settings):**
- `07-11` - Domain-specific rules (notebooks, Pine Script, etc.)
- Install based on your development needs

**4. Legacy Playbooks (Historical):**
- Available in `OLD/` directory for reference
- `02 - request.md` - Legacy standard development tasks
- `03 - refresh.md` - Legacy debugging persistent issues  
- `04 - retro.md` - Legacy session reflection and improvement

### Typical Session Workflow

1. **Install Core Framework:**
   - Install `GLOBAL-RULES.md` as a global rule in Cursor
   - Optionally install specialized extensions from `estensions/` directory
   - Framework automatically activates all protocols

2. **Observe Disciplined Execution:**
   - Agent announces operational phase (Reconnaissance, Planning, etc.)
   - Performs non-destructive research first
   - Executes plan with verifiable evidence
   - Runs tests autonomously
   - Concludes with mandatory self-audit

3. **Review Final Report:**
   - Agent provides summary with status markers
   - All evidence transparently available in chat log
   - Workspace left clean

4. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Framework includes built-in self-improvement protocols
   - Agent analyzes session and proposes Doctrine updates
   - Continuous learning and evolution

## üéØ Status Markers

The framework uses clear status indicators:

- `‚úÖ` - Objective completed successfully
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` - Recoverable issue encountered and fixed autonomously  
- `üöß` - Blocked; awaiting input or resource

## üß† Core Principles

1. **Research-First, Always** - Never act on assumption
2. **Extreme Ownership** - Own end-to-end system health
3. **Autonomous Problem-Solving** - Self-sufficient operation
4. **Unyielding Precision & Safety** - Respect operational environment
5. **Metacognitive Self-Improvement** - Continuous learning and evolution

## üîó MCP Server Integration

The framework includes protocols for leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

- **Automatic Detection** - MCP servers globally configured
- **Context-Aware Selection** - Based on technology stack and requirements
- **Knowledge Synthesis** - Combine insights from multiple sources
- **Template Application** - Use MCP-provided best practices

## üìã Cursor Plan Mode Compatibility

**Plan Mode (Shift+Tab) is fully compatible:**
- Generated plans follow Phase 0-5 structure
- Enhanced communication with structured overviews
- All operational protocols remain unchanged
- MCP server integration preserved

## ü§ù Contributing
