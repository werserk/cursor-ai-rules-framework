It prioritizes essential features over completeness, with excellent separation of concerns and minimal viable implementation. The codebase explicitly avoids overengineering and overkill, focusing only on what's necessary for the current requirements. The project follows a 'keep it simple' philosophy to ensure the codebase is understandable by other developers. Before implementing any new feature, the team researches Google Scholar and Stack Overflow to verify state-of-the-art approaches and avoid reinventing the wheel.",
