# Active Development Work

## Quick Start

### 🚀 **Create New Feature**
```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp docs/templates/features/corporate/template-corporate-feature.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-requirements.md

# 2. Create feature directory
mkdir docs/active/features/user-auth/

# 3. Copy and customize standards
cp docs/standards/corporate/logging.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-logging.md
cp docs/standards/corporate/testing_strategy.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-testing.md
```

### ⚡ **Execute Task**
```bash
# 1. Create task plan
# Use workflow rules to generate task plan in docs/active/tasks/

# 2. Execute task
# Use workflow rules to execute with safety protocols
```

## What Goes Here

### 📁 **Features** (`docs/active/features/`)
- **Feature-specific standards** that extend general standards
- **Custom configurations** for logging, testing, API, tech stack
- **Requirements** and acceptance criteria
- **Architecture decisions** and trade-offs

### 📋 **Tasks** (`docs/active/tasks/`)
- **Task execution plans** generated by workflow rules
- **Commit sequences** with safety protocols
- **Verification steps** and quality gates
- **User authorization** requirements

## Structure

### Features (`docs/active/features/`)
**Purpose**: Feature-specific standards and requirements for active development

**Organization**:
```
docs/active/features/
├── [feature-name]/              # Individual feature directory
│   ├── feature-logging.md       # Feature-specific logging configuration
│   ├── feature-testing.md       # Feature-specific testing strategy
│   ├── feature-api.yaml         # Feature-specific API specifications
│   ├── feature-tech.md          # Feature-specific technology requirements
│   └── feature-requirements.md  # Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
```

### Tasks (`docs/active/tasks/`)
**Purpose**: Task execution plans and workflow management

**Organization**:
```
docs/active/tasks/
├── [date]-[task-name].md        # Task execution plans
└── [date]-[feature]-task.md     # Feature-specific task plans
```

## 🛠️ **Daily Workflow**

### 1. **Start New Feature**
```bash
# Choose context: corporate or startup
# Copy template and create feature directory
# Declinate standards for your specific needs
```

### 2. **During Development**
```bash
# Update feature-specific standards as you go
# Apply context-appropriate testing and logging
# Use workflow rules for automated execution
```

### 3. **Complete Feature**
```bash
# Archive completed features
# Update general standards if needed
# Clean up active directory
```

## 📋 **Quick Reference**

### **Feature Standards**
- **feature-logging.md** - Custom logging for this feature
- **feature-testing.md** - Testing strategy specific to feature
- **feature-api.yaml** - API specs for this feature
- **feature-tech.md** - Technology requirements

### **Task Execution**
- **Use workflow rules** (plan.md or execute.md) for automated execution
- **Apply feature-specific standards** from `docs/active/features/[feature-name]/`
- **Fallback to general standards** from `docs/standards/` if feature-specific not available
- **Safety protocols** with user authorization
- **Quality gates** at each step

## ⚡ **Common Commands**

```bash
# Create new feature
mkdir docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
cp docs/templates/features/corporate/* docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
cp docs/standards/corporate/* docs/active/features/[feature-name]/feature-*

# Execute task
# Use workflow rules: plan.md or execute.md

# Archive completed work
mv docs/active/features/[feature-name]/ docs/archive/features/
mv docs/active/tasks/[task-file].md docs/archive/tasks/
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Feature Development**
1. **Start with templates** - Don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Declinate standards** - Extend, don't duplicate
3. **Update regularly** - Keep standards current
4. **Document decisions** - Why you made choices
5. **Archive when done** - Keep active directory clean

### **Task Execution**
1. **Use workflow rules** - Automated execution with safety
2. **User approval** - Required for all commits
3. **Context awareness** - Corporate vs startup approach
4. **Quality gates** - Verify before proceeding
5. **Error handling** - Rollback on failure
