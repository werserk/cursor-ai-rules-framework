# Active Development Work

## Quick Start

### 🚀 **Create New Feature (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)**
**IMPORTANT:** You must create features before calling plan.md

```bash
# 1. Create feature directory
mkdir docs/active/features/user-auth/

# 2. Copy template
cp docs/templates/corporate/template-corporate-feature.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-requirements.md

# 3. Copy guidelines as templates for feature-specific customization
cp docs/templates/corporate/template-corporate-logging.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-logging.md
cp docs/templates/corporate/template-corporate-testing.md \
   docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-testing.md

# 4. Customize feature-specific guidelines for your specific needs
# Edit docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-logging.md
# Edit docs/active/features/user-auth/feature-testing.md
```

### ⚡ **Execute Task**
```bash
# 1. Plan tasks for existing feature
# User: "Crea task plan per user-auth"
# System: Creates task plan for existing feature in docs/active/tasks/

# 2. Execute task plan
# User: "Esegui task plan"
# System: Automatically finds and executes task plan with safety protocols
```

## What Goes Here

### 📁 **Features** (`docs/active/features/`)
- **Feature-specific guidelines** that extend general guidelines
- **Custom configurations** for logging, testing, API, tech stack
- **Requirements** and acceptance criteria
- **Architecture decisions** and trade-offs
- **Current Status**: Directory exists but empty (features to be created)

### 📋 **Tasks** (`docs/active/tasks/`)
- **Task execution plans** generated by workflow rules
- **Commit sequences** with safety protocols
- **Verification steps** and quality gates
- **User authorization** requirements
- **Current Status**: Contains example.md file

## Structure

### Features (`docs/active/features/`)
**Purpose**: Feature-specific guidelines and requirements for active development

**Organization**:
```
docs/active/features/
├── [feature-name]/              # Individual feature directory (to be created)
│   ├── feature-logging.md       # Feature-specific logging configuration
│   ├── feature-testing.md       # Feature-specific testing strategy
│   ├── feature-api.yaml         # Feature-specific API specifications
│   ├── feature-tech.md          # Feature-specific technology requirements
│   └── feature-requirements.md  # Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
```
**Current Status**: Directory exists but empty - features need to be created manually

### Tasks (`docs/active/tasks/`)
**Purpose**: Task execution plans and workflow management

**Organization**:
```
docs/active/tasks/
├── example.md                   # Example task file (existing)
├── [date]-[task-name].md        # Task execution plans (to be created)
└── [date]-[feature]-task.md     # Feature-specific task plans (to be created)
```
**Current Status**: Contains example.md file - task plans to be generated by workflow rules

## 🛠️ **Daily Workflow**

### 1. **Start New Feature**
**Step-by-step process:**
1. Create directory: `mkdir docs/active/features/[feature-name]/`
2. Copy templates: `cp docs/templates/corporate/* docs/active/features/[feature-name]/`
3. Rename files: `mv template-corporate-feature.md feature-requirements.md`
4. Customize content: Edit feature-specific files
5. Call plan.md: "Crea task plan per [feature-name]"

### 2. **During Development**
```bash
# User: "Crea task plan per [feature-name]"
# System automatically:
# - Finds feature in docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
# - Creates task plan in docs/active/tasks/
# - Applies feature-specific guidelines from docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
# - Executes commits with safety protocols
# - Provides progress updates
```

### 3. **Complete Feature**
```bash
# Archive completed features
# Update general standards if needed
# Clean up active directory
```

## 📋 **Quick Reference**

### **Feature Guidelines**
- **feature-logging.md** - Custom logging for this feature (copied from docs/templates/ and customized)
- **feature-testing.md** - Testing strategy specific to feature (copied from docs/templates/ and customized)
- **feature-api.yaml** - API specs for this feature (copied from docs/templates/ and customized)
- **feature-tech.md** - Technology requirements (copied from docs/templates/ and customized)

### **Task Execution**
- **Use workflow rules** (plan.md or execute.md) for automated execution
- **Apply feature-specific guidelines** from `docs/active/features/[feature-name]/` AND general guidelines from `docs/guidelines/`
- **Integration approach:** Feature-specific guidelines extend and customize general guidelines for complete coverage
- **Safety protocols** with user authorization
- **Quality gates** at each step

## ⚡ **Common Commands**

```bash
# Create new feature
mkdir docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
cp docs/templates/corporate/* docs/active/features/[feature-name]/
# Rename files as needed

# Execute task
# Use workflow rules: plan.md or execute.md

# Archive completed work
mv docs/active/features/[feature-name]/ docs/archive/features/
mv docs/active/tasks/[task-file].md docs/archive/tasks/
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Feature Development**
1. **Create feature first** - User must create docs/active/features/[feature-name]/ before calling plan.md
2. **Copy guidelines as templates** - Use docs/guidelines/ as starting point
3. **Customize for feature needs** - Adapt guidelines to specific feature requirements
4. **Update regularly** - Keep feature-specific guidelines current
5. **Document decisions** - Why you made choices
6. **Archive when done** - Keep active directory clean

### **Task Execution**
1. **Create feature first** - User must create feature before calling plan.md
2. **Use workflow rules** - Automated execution with safety
3. **User approval** - Required for all commits
4. **Context awareness** - Corporate vs startup approach
5. **Feature-specific guidelines** - Extend general guidelines
6. **Quality gates** - Verify before proceeding
7. **Error handling** - Rollback on failure
