# Documentation System Architecture

## What This System Does

This documentation system provides **context-aware development workflows** that automatically adapt to your project type:

### 🏢 **Corporate Context**
- **Comprehensive standards**: Full testing, logging, security protocols
- **Detailed documentation**: Complete requirements and specifications  
- **Enterprise-grade**: Security, compliance, and scalability focus
- **Quality gates**: Rigorous testing and validation at each step

### 🚀 **Startup Context**
- **Simplified standards**: Essential testing and logging only
- **Quick documentation**: Rapid iteration and MVP focus
- **Agile approach**: Fast delivery with minimal overhead
- **Essential quality**: Core functionality with streamlined processes

## How It Works

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Design
- **Corporate Context**: Comprehensive standards, detailed documentation, enterprise-grade security
- **Startup Context**: Simplified standards, rapid iteration, MVP-focused approach
- **Adaptive Application**: Standards automatically applied based on project context

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
- **Standards**: General best practices and guidelines
- **Templates**: Reusable starting points for common tasks
- **Active Work**: Current development work with specific requirements
- **Archive**: Completed work for reference and learning

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- **Standards**: What to do and how to do it
- **Templates**: Starting points for new work
- **Active Work**: Current development with specific needs
- **Workflow**: Automated execution and safety protocols

## System Components

### Standards Layer (`docs/standards/`)
**Purpose**: Define general best practices and guidelines
**Structure**:
```
docs/standards/
├── corporate/           # Enterprise-grade standards
│   ├── logging.md       # Comprehensive logging strategy
│   ├── testing_strategy.md # Full testing protocols
│   ├── tech_stack.md    # Complete technology stack
│   ├── PRD.md          # Product requirements template
│   └── openapi.yaml    # API specification standards
└── startup/            # Startup-optimized standards
    ├── startup-logging.md    # Quick logging setup
    ├── startup-testing.md    # Essential testing
    └── startup-tech.md      # Minimal tech stack
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of development
- **Context-specific**: Different approaches for corporate vs startup
- **Maintainable**: Regular updates and reviews
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new standards

### Templates Layer (`docs/templates/`)
**Purpose**: Provide reusable starting points for common tasks
**Structure**:
```
docs/templates/
├── features/           # Feature development templates
│   ├── corporate/     # Detailed feature templates
│   └── startup/       # Quick feature templates
└── tasks/             # Task execution templates
    ├── corporate/     # Comprehensive task templates
    └── startup/       # Simplified task templates
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Reusable**: Standard starting points for common tasks
- **Context-aware**: Different templates for different contexts
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all necessary aspects
- **Maintainable**: Regular updates and improvements

### Active Work Layer (`docs/active/`)
**Purpose**: Manage current development work with specific requirements
**Structure**:
```
docs/active/
├── features/          # Active feature development
│   └── [feature-name]/ # Feature-specific standards
│       ├── feature-logging.md    # Custom logging for this feature
│       ├── feature-testing.md    # Testing strategy for this feature
│       ├── feature-api.yaml      # API specs for this feature
│       ├── feature-tech.md       # Technology requirements
│       └── feature-requirements.md # Feature requirements
└── tasks/             # Active task execution
    └── [task-files].md # Task plans generated by workflow rules
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Specific**: Tailored to individual features and tasks
- **Dynamic**: Updated during development
- **Traceable**: Linked to general standards
- **Archivable**: Moved to archive when complete

### Workflow Layer (`.cursor/rules/workflow/`)
**Purpose**: Automated execution and safety protocols
**Components**:
- **plan.md**: Create task plans from templates and execute commits
- **execute.md**: Execute existing task plans from `docs/active/tasks/`
- **Safety protocols**: User authorization, error handling, rollback
- **Context awareness**: Apply feature-specific standards from `docs/active/features/[feature-name]/`
- **Fallback**: Use general standards from `docs/standards/` if feature-specific not available

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Standards Creation
```
General Requirements → Standards Definition → Context-Specific Standards
```

### 2. Template Creation
```
Standards → Template Generation → Context-Aware Templates
```

### 3. Active Work Creation
```
Templates → Feature/Task Creation → Feature-Specific Standards
```

### 4. Workflow Execution
```
Active Work → Feature-Specific Standards → Automated Execution → User Authorization
```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Standards Integration
- **General standards** provide the foundation
- **Context-specific standards** adapt to project needs
- **Feature-specific standards** extend and override as needed
- **Consistent application** across all development work

### 2. Template Integration
- **Templates** provide starting points
- **Standards** provide the framework
- **Active work** provides the specifics
- **Workflow** provides the execution

### 3. Workflow Integration
- **Automated execution** where possible
- **Manual oversight** for critical decisions
- **User authorization** for all commits
- **Safety protocols** for all operations

## Quality Assurance Architecture

### 3. Compliance
- **Standards compliance** enforced
- **Quality gates** at each step
- **Documentation** of all decisions
- **Regular audits** and reviews

## Performance Architecture
