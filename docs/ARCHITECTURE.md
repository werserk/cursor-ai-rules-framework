# Documentation System Architecture

## What This System Does

This documentation system provides **context-aware development workflows** that automatically adapt to your project type:

### 🏢 **Corporate Context**
- **Comprehensive standards**: Full testing, logging, security protocols
- **Detailed documentation**: Complete requirements and specifications  
- **Enterprise-grade**: Security, compliance, and scalability focus
- **Quality gates**: Rigorous testing and validation at each step

### 🚀 **Startup Context**
- **Simplified standards**: Essential testing and logging only
- **Quick documentation**: Rapid iteration and MVP focus
- **Agile approach**: Fast delivery with minimal overhead
- **Essential quality**: Core functionality with streamlined processes

## How It Works

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Design
- **Corporate Context**: Comprehensive standards, detailed documentation, enterprise-grade security
- **Startup Context**: Simplified standards, rapid iteration, MVP-focused approach
- **Adaptive Application**: Standards automatically applied based on project context

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
- **Standards**: General best practices and guidelines
- **Templates**: Reusable starting points for common tasks
- **Active Work**: Current development work with specific requirements
- **Archive**: Completed work for reference and learning

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- **Standards**: What to do and how to do it
- **Templates**: Starting points for new work
- **Active Work**: Current development with specific needs
- **Workflow**: Automated execution and safety protocols

## System Components

### Guidelines Layer (`docs/guidelines/`)
**Purpose**: Define general best practices and guidelines
**Structure**:
```
docs/guidelines/
├── corporate/           # Enterprise-grade guidelines (placeholder)
│   └── example.md       # Placeholder file
└── startup/            # Startup-optimized guidelines (placeholder)
    └── example.md       # Placeholder file
```
**Current Status**: Minimal implementation with placeholder files - to be populated with actual guidelines

**Characteristics**:
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of development
- **Context-specific**: Different approaches for corporate vs startup
- **Maintainable**: Regular updates and reviews
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new standards

### Templates Layer (`docs/templates/`)
**Purpose**: Provide reusable starting points for common tasks
**Structure**:
```
docs/templates/
├── corporate/         # Corporate templates (6 files)
│   ├── template-corporate-feature.md
│   ├── template-corporate-logging.md
│   ├── template-corporate-openapi.yaml
│   ├── template-corporate-PRD.md
│   ├── template-corporate-task.md
│   ├── template-corporate-tech.md
│   └── template-corporate-testing.md
└── startup/          # Startup templates (5 files)
    ├── template-startup-feature.md
    ├── template-startup-logging.md
    ├── template-startup-task.md
    ├── template-startup-tech.md
    └── template-startup-testing.md
```
**Current Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive template files

**Characteristics**:
- **Reusable**: Standard starting points for common tasks
- **Context-aware**: Different templates for different contexts
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all necessary aspects
- **Maintainable**: Regular updates and improvements

### Active Work Layer (`docs/active/`)
**Purpose**: Manage current development work with specific requirements
**Structure**:
```
docs/active/
├── features/          # Active feature development (currently empty)
│   └── [feature-name]/ # Feature-specific standards (to be created)
│       ├── feature-logging.md    # Custom logging for this feature
│       ├── feature-testing.md    # Testing strategy for this feature
│       ├── feature-api.yaml      # API specs for this feature
│       ├── feature-tech.md       # Technology requirements
│       └── feature-requirements.md # Feature requirements
├── tasks/             # Active task execution
│   └── example.md     # Example task file (existing)
└── README.md          # Active development guide
```
**Current Status**: Features directory empty, tasks contains example.md, README.md provides guidance

**Characteristics**:
- **Specific**: Tailored to individual features and tasks
- **Dynamic**: Updated during development
- **Traceable**: Linked to general standards
- **Archivable**: Moved to archive when complete

### Workflow Layer (`.cursor/rules/workflow/`)
**Purpose**: Automated execution and safety protocols
**Components**:
- **plan.md**: Create task plans for EXISTING features
- **execute.md**: Execute existing task plans from `docs/active/tasks/`
- **Safety protocols**: User authorization, error handling, rollback
- **Context awareness**: Apply feature-specific guidelines from `docs/active/features/[feature-name]/` AND general guidelines from `docs/guidelines/`
- **Integration approach**: Feature-specific guidelines extend and customize general guidelines for complete coverage

**Current Status**: Fully implemented and functional
- **plan.md**: Working with globs `["docs/templates/corporate/*.md", "docs/templates/startup/*.md"]`
- **execute.md**: Working with globs `["docs/active/tasks/*.md"]`
- **Safety protocols**: User authorization, push prohibition, rollback mechanisms
- **Path verification**: All referenced paths exist and are functional

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Guidelines Creation
```
General Requirements → Guidelines Definition → Context-Specific Guidelines
```

### 2. Template Creation
```
Guidelines → Template Generation → Context-Aware Templates
```

### 3. Active Work Creation
```
Templates → Feature/Task Creation → Feature-Specific Guidelines
```

### 4. Workflow Execution
```
Active Work → Feature-Specific Guidelines + General Guidelines → Automated Execution → User Authorization
```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Guidelines Integration
- **General guidelines** provide the foundation and best practices
- **Context-specific guidelines** adapt to project needs (corporate vs startup)
