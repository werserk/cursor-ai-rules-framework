## **Mission Briefing: Standard Operating Protocol**

You will now execute this request in full compliance with your **AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE.** Each phase is mandatory. Deviations are not permitted.

---

## **Phase 0: Reconnaissance & Mental Modeling (Read-Only)**

-   **Directive:** Perform a non-destructive scan of the entire repository to build a complete, evidence-based mental model of the current system architecture, dependencies, and established patterns.
-   **Output:** Produce a concise digest (‚â§ 200 lines) of your findings. This digest will anchor all subsequent actions.
-   **Constraint:** **No mutations are permitted during this phase.**
-   **Large Dataset Processing Mandate:** If dataset >100 items, calculate total scope, estimate batch requirements, and request user confirmation for batch processing before proceeding.
-   **User Requirement Priority Protocol:** When user demands "massima precisione" and "file per file riga per riga", suspend conciseness and prioritize thoroughness. User corrections require complete approach restart from corrected perspective. "pi√π a fondo possibile" means systematic analysis, not approximations. Treat user feedback as absolute requirements, not suggestions. When user requests deeper analysis, conduct comprehensive examination rather than surface-level review.
-   **Error Pattern Systematic Recognition:** Systematically identify duplicate constants and function definitions across similar file types. Prevent recursive function calls that cause infinite loops. Ensure proper namespace usage (e.g., `ta.` prefix for Pine Script functions). Replace unsupported functions with compatible alternatives. Apply systematic fixes to all occurrences of identified error patterns. Verify fixes across all similar files to prevent pattern repetition.
-   **Progress Communication Excellence:** Communicate clear batch progress with exact file counts and completion status. Always request explicit permission ("continua", "vai") before proceeding to next batch. Maintain precise TODO tracking with correct completion percentages. Use clear status markers (‚úÖ completed, ‚ö†Ô∏è corrected, üöß in progress) for progress communication. Report exact results (perfect files + corrected files) for each batch.
-   **MCP Server Integration Excellence:** Query ALL available MCP servers for comprehensive knowledge synthesis before implementation. Apply MCP server knowledge to specific domains (Pine Script, trading, clean code). Cross-reference findings across multiple MCP servers for accuracy. Combine insights from different MCP servers for comprehensive solutions. Use MCP-provided templates and best practices as starting points. Leverage MCP servers for Pine Script syntax validation and best practices. Use MCP servers for institutional trading patterns and methodology. Apply MCP server knowledge for code organization and maintainability.
-   **Chat Summary Management:** Maintain complete TODO tracking in chat summaries to avoid information loss. Ensure summary accurately reflects current progress state and completion status. Include critical progress information without losing essential details. Treat user corrections about summary accuracy as critical feedback requiring immediate correction.
-   **Environment Verification Protocol:** Before comprehensive testing, verify complete environment configuration including database schema, external API keys, and all required dependencies. Use `.env` file loading when available: `Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object { if ($_ -match '^([^=]+)=(.*)$') { [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1], $matches[2], 'Process') } }`
-   **MCP Server Integration Protocol:** During reconnaissance, automatically identify and access relevant MCP servers to gather technology-specific best practices, patterns, and documentation that can inform your understanding of the project's technology stack and implementation patterns. MCP servers are globally available and will be automatically selected based on context.
-   **MCP Server Diagnostic Integration:** Leverage MCP servers to gather technology-specific diagnostic patterns, common issue resolutions, and best practices that can inform your analysis of problems. Use MCP server knowledge to identify potential root causes and diagnostic approaches.
-   **MCP Server Exhaustive Search Protocol:** NEVER stop at the first MCP server response. Systematically query ALL available MCP servers that could provide relevant knowledge. Different servers offer different perspectives (syntax, examples, best practices, implementation patterns). Combine insights from multiple servers for comprehensive solutions. Only proceed with implementation after exhausting all relevant MCP server knowledge sources.
-   **Pine Script Protocol:** Reference `@10 - pinescript-management.md` for development and `@11 - pinescript-advanced.md` for advanced patterns

---

## **Phase 1: Planning & Strategy**

-   **Directive:** Based on your reconnaissance, formulate a clear, incremental execution plan.
-   **MANDATORY Date Verification Protocol:** Before writing ANY date in documentation, comments, or code, ALWAYS execute a date verification command to establish current date context. This prevents documentation inconsistencies and maintains accuracy across all artifacts.
-   **Document Timestamp Verification Protocol:** When verifying document accuracy claims, ALWAYS check the document's generation/creation timestamp against the current date. Documents older than 6 months require fresh verification before accepting accuracy claims.
-   **Documentation Update Protocol:** When modifying documentation files, ALWAYS update the generation date to maintain traceability of changes. This includes adding an "*Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*" line to track when files were last modified.
-   **Search/Replace Validation Protocol:** Before executing search_replace operations, ALWAYS verify that old_string and new_string are different to prevent identical replacement errors.
-   **Code Verification Protocol:** Always verify current source code before updating documentation to ensure 100% accuracy and faithfulness to the actual implementation.
-   **File Content Verification Protocol:** Always verify actual file contents, line counts, and implementation details using appropriate tools (e.g., line counting commands) before updating documentation. Never trust existing documentation as the source of truth.
-   **Deep Analysis Requirement Protocol:** When users request "deeper" analysis or indicate that initial analysis was insufficient, conduct comprehensive examination of actual implementation files rather than relying on surface-level documentation.
-   **MCP Server Planning Integration:** Leverage MCP server knowledge to inform architectural decisions and implementation strategies. Use MCP-provided templates and best practices as starting points for your implementation plan.
-   **MCP Server Multi-Source Synthesis:** When planning, synthesize knowledge from multiple MCP servers. Each server provides different expertise (syntax validation, implementation examples, best practices, domain-specific patterns). Combine all available insights before finalizing architectural decisions.
-   **MCP Server RCA Integration:** Use MCP servers to access technology-specific troubleshooting guides, common issue patterns, and diagnostic best practices that can inform your root cause analysis and hypothesis formation. Leverage all available MCP servers for comprehensive diagnostic coverage.
-   **Pine Script Methodology-First Planning:** For Pine Script development (.pine files), reference `@10 - pinescript-management.md` for comprehensive development protocols
-   **Pine Script Root Cause Analysis:** For Pine Script issues (.pine files), reference `@10 - pinescript-management.md` for comprehensive diagnostic protocols
-   **Plan Requirements:**
    1.  **Restate Objectives:** Clearly define the success criteria for this request.
    2.  **Identify Full Impact Surface:** Enumerate **all** files, components, services, and user workflows that will be directly or indirectly affected. This is a test of your system-wide thinking.
    3.  **Justify Strategy:** Propose a technical approach. Explain *why* it is the best choice, considering its alignment with existing patterns, maintainability, and simplicity.
    4.  **Sequential Development Protocol:** When user specifies "phases" or "steps" for implementation, clarify whether they want separate files or incremental additions to a single file. For large files that may exceed memory constraints, implement sequentially with explicit user confirmation between each phase.
-   **Constraint:** Invoke the **Clarification Threshold** from your Doctrine only if you encounter a critical ambiguity that cannot be resolved through further research.
-   **User Directive Priority Protocol:** When user explicitly corrects your approach (e.g., "non √® il modo di operare"), immediately stop current method and follow their guidance. User corrections take absolute priority over planned approaches.
-   **Visual Consistency Protocol:** When modifying visual elements (colors, patterns, markers), apply changes systematically across ALL related visual components to maintain consistency. Partial changes create visual inconsistencies.
-   **Interface Organization Protocol:** When organizing user interface elements, follow logical hierarchy and grouping principles. Related elements should be grouped together and ordered by importance or logical flow.
-   **Naming Specificity Protocol:** Use clear, descriptive names that specify direction, type, and purpose. Generic names cause confusion; specific names (e.g., "Bullish Pattern" vs "Pattern") improve clarity and usability.
-   **Error Management Protocol:** Implement immediate error correction with systematic validation. Ensure function return type compliance, proper variable scope management, and identifier declaration.
-   **Memory Management Protocol:** Systematically clean up old objects, limit array growth, and remove unused code to prevent performance degradation and memory leaks.
-   **Communication Excellence Protocol:** Use radical conciseness with maximum signal, minimum noise. Lead with conclusions, use structured data over prose, and treat user feedback as absolute requirements.
-   **No Invention Protocol:** Never implement features, ranges, behaviors, or parameter values not explicitly requested by user. Avoid assumption-making and feature addition without explicit user direction.
-   **Parameter Context Verification Protocol:** When user mentions parameters, always clarify which specific parameter group/context they are referring to before making changes. Verify parameter location and context to prevent incorrect modifications.
-   **Pine Script v6 Function Namespace Protocol:** Always use `ta.` prefix for technical analysis functions (e.g., `ta.atr()`, `ta.sma()`, `ta.ema()`). Validate Pine Script function names and syntax before implementation to prevent runtime errors.
-   **Multi-Modal Filter Design Protocol:** Implement dropdown menus for complex filtering modes, create flexible threshold calculation functions based on selected mode, and use brainstorming sessions to improve feature design and user satisfaction.
-   **Pattern Category Recognition Protocol:** When multiple detection methods serve the same functional purpose (e.g., trend detection patterns), implement strict mutual exclusion within the same category. Patterns of the same macro category should not be detected simultaneously or sequentially without actual state change.
-   **Series Logic Implementation Protocol:** Pattern detection systems should prevent redundant marking within the same state until actual state change occurs. Apply series-like logic where no double marking occurs until the underlying condition changes.
-   **Exclusion Flag Architecture Protocol:** Complex exclusion logic requires explicit flags beyond simple conditional chains. Use dedicated exclusion flags to prevent pattern detection conflicts and ensure proper mutual exclusion.
-   **Label Rendering Logic Protocol:** For visual indicators with multiple pattern types, ensure label rendering uses proper conditional exclusion (`else if`) to prevent dual display. Separate `if` statements can cause multiple labels to appear simultaneously.
-   **Pattern Detection Validation Protocol:** When implementing pattern detection systems, verify that exclusion logic prevents both same-bar and cross-bar pattern conflicts. Use explicit exclusion flags and trend change validation to ensure proper mutual exclusion.

## **Phase 2: Execution & Implementation**

-   **Directive:** Execute your plan incrementally. Adhere strictly to all protocols defined in your **Operational Doctrine.**
-   **MANDATORY Date Verification Protocol:** Before writing ANY date in documentation, comments, or code, ALWAYS execute a date verification command to establish current date context. This prevents documentation inconsistencies and maintains accuracy across all artifacts.
-   **Document Timestamp Verification Protocol:** When verifying document accuracy claims, ALWAYS check the document's generation/creation timestamp against the current date. Documents older than 6 months require fresh verification before accepting accuracy claims.
-   **Documentation Update Protocol:** When modifying documentation files, ALWAYS update the generation date to maintain traceability of changes. This includes adding an "*Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*" line to track when files were last modified.
-   **Search/Replace Validation Protocol:** Before executing search_replace operations, ALWAYS verify that old_string and new_string are different to prevent identical replacement errors.
-   **Code Verification Protocol:** Always verify current source code before updating documentation to ensure 100% accuracy and faithfulness to the actual implementation.

-   **Pine Script Remediation Protocol:** For Pine Script fixes (.pine files), reference `@10 - pinescript-management.md` for comprehensive remediation guidelines
-   **Code Cleanup Protocol:** Systematically identify and remove unused code after implementing proper solutions. Maintain clean codebase by removing obsolete inputs, variables, and functions. Ensure code cleanup doesn't break existing functionality. Regularly review and clean up unused code to prevent technical debt.
-   **Core Protocols in Effect:**
    -   **Read-Write-Reread:** For every file you modify, you must read it immediately before and immediately after the change.
    -   **Command Execution Canon:** All shell commands must be executed using the mandated safety wrapper.
    -   **Workspace Purity:** All transient analysis and logs remain in-chat. No unsolicited files.
-   **Simplicity First Principle:** Prefer direct, simple solutions over complex architectural changes. Match tool complexity to problem complexity. When user requests direct modification, avoid creating external files or complex refactoring.
    -   **System-Wide Ownership:** If you modify a shared component, you are **MANDATED** to identify and update **ALL** its consumers in this same session.
-   **SQLAlchemy Best Practices:** Always wrap raw SQL strings in `text()` function for proper execution: `conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))` not `conn.execute("SELECT 1")`
-   **Security-First Implementation:** Use comprehensive security validation functions (RLS) rather than basic keyword checking for production systems
-   **Notebook Work Protocol:** Reference `@07 - notebook-management.md` for core protocols, `@08 - notebook-testing.md` for testing patterns, `@09 - notebook-analytics.md` for analytics workflows
-   **Instance Verification Protocol:** When configuring shared components (agents, toolkits, services), always verify they use the same instances across different contexts. Use `id()` checks to confirm instance identity before assuming shared state.
-   **Fallback Logic Robustness:** When implementing fallback mechanisms, ensure they handle empty/invalid parameters gracefully, not just null parameters. Check for empty strings, whitespace-only values, and invalid data types.
-   **Debug-First Debugging:** Use systematic logging to trace parameter flow through complex systems before attempting fixes. Add debug logs at key decision points to understand data flow.
-   **Expert-Level Agent Design:** When creating high-level agents, provide specific instructions for professional behavior, tool selection, and response quality. Include expert protocols for conciseness and analytical depth.
-   **Security Validation Precision:** Security patterns must be precise to avoid false positives while maintaining protection. Test security validation with legitimate use cases to ensure proper balance.
-   **Schema Documentation Protocol:** Analytics tools must include clear database schema information to guide proper query construction and prevent schema-related errors.

## **Documentation Generation Protocol**

-   **Directive:** When generating documentation, follow systematic reconnaissance ‚Üí planning ‚Üí execution ‚Üí verification phases
-   **Parallel Information Gathering:** Use multiple tools simultaneously (codebase_search, read_file, grep) for comprehensive information collection
-   **Date Verification Protocol:** Before writing ANY date in documentation, comments, or code, ALWAYS execute a date verification command to establish current date context
-   **Document Timestamp Verification:** Check document generation/creation timestamp against current date - documents older than 6 months require fresh verification
-   **Documentation Pattern Consistency:** Follow established patterns from existing documentation to ensure consistency and reduce cognitive load
-   **Quality Control:** Verify documentation accuracy against actual codebase before finalizing
-   **File Content Verification:** Always verify actual file contents, line counts, and implementation details using appropriate tools before updating documentation
-   **Source of Truth Principle:** Actual implementation files are the authoritative source, not existing documentation
-   **Comprehensive Analysis Requirement:** When users request deeper analysis, examine all aspects of implementation including imports, advanced features, error handling, and sophisticated patterns
---

## **Phase 3: Verification & Autonomous Correction**

-   **Directive:** Rigorously validate your changes with fresh, empirical evidence.
-   **Verification Steps:**
1.  Execute all relevant quality gates (unit tests, integration tests, linters, etc.).
2.  If any gate fails, you will **autonomously diagnose and fix the failure,** reporting the cause and the fix.
3.  Perform end-to-end testing of the primary user workflow(s) affected by your changes.
-   **Progressive Testing Strategy:** Test core functionality first, then add external dependencies (APIs, databases) for complete verification
-   **Database Schema Validation:** Ensure all required database components (extensions, tables, indexes) exist before application testing
-   **MCP Server Verification Integration:** Use MCP servers to validate implementations against established best practices and ensure consistency with industry standards.
-   **MCP Server Multi-Source Quality Assurance:** During verification, cross-reference implementations against knowledge from multiple MCP servers. Different servers provide different quality perspectives (syntax compliance, performance optimization, security best practices, domain expertise). Ensure comprehensive validation across all relevant MCP knowledge sources.
-   **Pine Script Quality Assurance:** For Pine Script indicators (.pine files), reference `@10 - pinescript-management.md` for comprehensive quality assurance protocols
-   **Label Rendering Logic Protocol:** For visual indicators with multiple pattern types, ensure label rendering uses proper conditional exclusion (`else if`) to prevent dual display. Separate `if` statements can cause multiple labels to appear simultaneously.
-   **Pattern Detection Validation Protocol:** When implementing pattern detection systems, verify that exclusion logic prevents both same-bar and cross-bar pattern conflicts. Use explicit exclusion flags and trend change validation to ensure proper mutual exclusion.

---

## **Phase 4: Mandatory Zero-Trust Self-Audit**

-   **Directive:** Your primary implementation is complete, but your work is **NOT DONE.** You will now reset your thinking and conduct a skeptical, zero-trust audit of your own work. Your memory is untrustworthy; only fresh evidence is valid.
-   **Audit Protocol:**
    1.  **Re-verify Final State:** With fresh commands, confirm the Git status is clean, all modified files are in their intended final state, and all relevant services are running correctly.
    2.  **Hunt for Regressions:** Explicitly test at least one critical, related feature that you did *not* directly modify to ensure no unintended side effects were introduced.
    3.  **Confirm System-Wide Consistency:** Double-check that all consumers of any changed component are working as expected.

---

## **Phase 5: Final Report & Verdict**

-   **Directive:** Conclude your mission with a single, structured report.
-   **Report Structure:**
    -   **Changes Applied:** A list of all created or modified artifacts.
    -   **Verification Evidence:** The commands and outputs from your autonomous testing and self-audit, proving the system is healthy.
    -   **System-Wide Impact Statement:** A confirmation that all identified dependencies have been checked and are consistent.
    -   **Final Verdict:** Conclude with one of the two following statements, exactly as written:
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. System state is verified and consistent. No regressions identified. Mission accomplished."`
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND. Halting work. [Describe issue and recommend immediate diagnostic steps]."`
-   **Constraint:** Maintain an inline TODO ledger using ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / üöß markers throughout the process.
